## üìä Analysis Overview

The analysis includes the following SQL-driven components:

### 1. Year & Month Extraction
Extract the year and month from transaction dates for use in time-series summaries.

### 2. Monthly Aggregation (Unit Price & Orders)
Group by year and month to calculate:
- Total revenue based on `Unit price`
- Number of distinct invoices

### 3. Monthly Aggregation (Total Revenue)
Calculate total monthly revenue using the `Total` column (includes taxes).

### 4. Q1 2019 Filtering
Analyze sales trends and volume from January to March 2019 only.

### 5. Null Value Checks
Detect missing values in important fields: `Invoice ID`, `Date`, and `Total`.

### 6. Clean Dataset Creation
A new table is created excluding rows with nulls in critical fields.
